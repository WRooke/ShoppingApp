# UI / UX

## UI / UX

### General principles
- Mobile-first. Primary use is on Android phones in portrait orientation over local WiFi.
- The app is accessed via browser shortcut (not a PWA install), so no service worker needed.
- Rough-but-functional is acceptable for Phase 1–5. Phase 6 is the polish pass.
- Every action should have visible feedback (loading state, success confirmation, error message).
- Navigation: persistent bottom nav bar on mobile with icons for: Home, Recipes, Plan, Settings,
  Diagnostics.

### Tone & copy
- Plain language. No jargon. Sentence case everywhere.
- Actions describe exactly what happens: "Add to list" not "Submit". "Save recipe" not "Confirm".
- Error messages explain what went wrong and what to do: "Couldn't reach AnyList — check your
  connection and try again" not "Error 500".

### Accessibility
- Tap targets minimum 44px.
- Sufficient colour contrast.
- Do not rely on colour alone to convey state.

### Design direction (Phase 6 polish)
- Functional kitchen-utility aesthetic — not a food blog. Clean, fast, practical.
- Palette: neutral warm whites and greys, one functional accent colour (not terracotta/clay).
- Typography: one sans-serif family, clear hierarchy, no decorative type.
- No animations except functional transitions (e.g. checklist item ticked → slides/fades out).
